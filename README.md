# OpenMPF Evaluation Framework

Welcome to the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) Evaluation Framework Project!

## What is the OpenMPF?

OpenMPF provides a platform to perform content detection and extraction on bulk multimedia, enabling users to analyze,
search, and share information through the extraction of objects, keywords, thumbnails, and other contextual data.

OpenMPF enables users to build configurable media processing pipelines, enabling the rapid development and deployment of
analytic algorithms and large-scale media processing applications.

### Search and Share

Simplify large-scale media processing and enable the extraction of meaningful content

### Open API

Apply cutting-edge algorithms such as face detection and object classification

### Flexible Architecture

Integrate into your existing environment or use OpenMPF as a standalone application

## Overview

This repository contains code for the OpenMPF evaluation framework and related files. The framework is used for
generating metrics such as speed, accuracy, precision, recall, etc., of OpenMPF component algorithms, depending on the
algorithm type (e.g. face detection, text detection, speech detection, object detection and classification, etc.).

## Getting Started

The evaluation framework uses the [CLI Runner](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/CLI_RUNNER.md) to
execute jobs using pre-built OpenMPF Docker images, such as those on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openmpf).

### Quick Start

To run the evaluation framework run `python3 evaluation_framework.py`
